# Synthetic Market Research
Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained attention for their ability to generate human-like text across a wide range of tasks. In parallel, the use of synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional data collection methods, particularly in domains where collecting high-quality human data is costly, time-consuming, or constrained by privacy concerns. This Repository offers a minimalistic framework for generating synthetic personas and use them to answer a survey.

## How to use
Install requirements.txt in e.g. pipenv
```bash
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
pipenv shell
```

Adjust the parameters in ```models/dataset_generator.py``` to your requirements. The encodings for some values are shown in ```data/example_encodings.csv```. The given parameters are:
* Needed survey base ```n = xxx```
* Age probabilities ```age_probs = [0.xxx,0.xxx,0.xxx]```
* Age ranges ``` age_ranges = {"key":list(range(xx,xx),...}```
* Gender probabilities ```genders = np.random.choice([1, 2], size=n, p=[0.xxx, 0.xxx]```
* Origins probabilities ```origin = np.random.choice([1, 2], size=n, p=[0.xxx, 0.xxx]```
* Relationship status</br>
```python 
for age in ages:
    if 16 <= age <= 20:
        status = np.random.choice([1, 2], p=[0.xxx, 0.xxx])
    elif 21 <= age <= 25:
        status = np.random.choice([1, 2], p=[0.xxx, 0.xxx])
    else:  # 26â€“30
        status = np.random.choice([1, 2], p=[0.xxx, 0.xxx])
    relationship_status.append(status)
```
* Education depends on which educational degrees you would like to use</br> 
```python 
education_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
education_probs = np.array([0.xxx, 0.xxx, 0.xxx, 0.xxx, 0.xxx])
education_probs /= education_probs.sum()
education = np.random.choice(education_values, size=n, p=education_probs) 
```
